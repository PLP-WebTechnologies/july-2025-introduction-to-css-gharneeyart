        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. The term “HyperText” refers to text that contains links to other documents or resources, enabling easy navigation between them. “Markup” refers to the use of tags that define the structure, organization, and meaning of the content, telling web browsers how to display it. As a language, HTML provides a set of rules for writing these tags so that text, images, videos, and other elements can be properly presented on a webpage.</p>

        <h1 id="second-head">CSS</h1>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and positioning, making web content visually appealing and user-friendly. The term “cascading” refers to the way styles are applied based on a priority system, where rules can override one another depending on their specificity and the order in which they are defined. In essence, CSS works alongside HTML to separate a webpage’s content from its design, enabling cleaner code and more flexible styling.</p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level programming language primarily used to add interactivity, dynamic behavior, and complex functionality to webpages. While HTML structures the content and CSS controls its appearance, JavaScript enables real-time updates, form validation, animations, interactive menus, and communication with servers without reloading the page. It is executed by web browsers, making it a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS, and it can also be used on servers and other platforms through environments like Node.js.</p>
